# Quick Quiz

This repository houses web modules containing quizzes, flashcards, and other apps to help teachers connect with students. I created these apps for a university professor I worked closely with in the past as part of a site-wide redesign. I hope others will find it useful for their classes as well.

## No server-side support is required!

You can change the exercise questions using the Javascript arrays contained in each folder. Everything can be uploaded, and will work, on a personal website or university-hosted site.

## Styled and unstyled versions
There are two versions of each app that you can choose depending on preference. The styled, or 'standard' versions have some basic styling courtesy Google's Material Design framework. These are essentially ready to go. The unstyled, or 'basic' versions have as little CSS as possible. You can style them however you wish to fit your website.

## Who is this for?

Everyone, especially those without programming experience. I wanted to make something that was easy to make changes to and load up without much fuss. This ease is why I chose to use Google's Material Design framework for styling. You can add these to any website without having to play around with CSS and other scripts. Win-win!

## Can I contribute/fork this project?

Please do! I wrote these with only a few weeks of Javascript under my belt (although experience in other programming languages helped considerably). These are bound to be a bit rough under the edges, but they work well and that's what matters, right?

## This is a lot of text! Is there a good way to view the code?

My personal recommendation is [Atom](https://atom.io/). It has delightful syntax highlighting and is available on every platform.

## What's next? 
Here is a short to-do list of features/apps I would like to add at some point:
* Ability to select which flashcard questions you want to practice (preferably dynamically while using the app). 
* Other quiz types, like fill in the blank and an autocorrect 'long answer'.
