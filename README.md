# Welcome to Student Testing Apps by Lars Hedlund

Web modules containing quizzes, flashcards, and other apps to help teachers connect with students. I created these apps for a university professor I worked closely with in the past as part of a site-wide redesign. I hope others will find it useful for their classes as well.

## No server-side support is required!

You can change the exercise questions using the Javascript arrays contained in each folder. Everything can be uploaded, and will work, on a personal website or university-hosted site.

## Who is this for?

Everyone, especially those without programming experience. I wanted to make something that was easy to make changes to and load up without much fuss. This ease is why I chose to use Google's Material Design framework for styling. You can add these to any website without having to play around with CSS and other scripts. Win-win!

## Can I contribute/fork this project?

Please do! I wrote these with only a few weeks of Javascript under my belt (although experience in other programming languages helped considerably). These are bound to be a bit rough under the edges, but they work well and that's what matters, right?

## This is a lot of text! Is there a good way to view the code?

My personal recommendation is [Atom](https://atom.io/). It has delightful syntax highlighting and is available on every platform.
