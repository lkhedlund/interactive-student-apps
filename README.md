# Quick Quiz

This repository houses web applications containing quizzes, flashcards, and other apps to help teachers connect with students. I created these apps for a university professor I worked closely with in the past as part of a site-wide redesign. I hope others will find it useful for their classes as well.

## Installation Instructions
To install, copy all of the files from the app folder onto your website. For example, if you wanted to install the flashcard app you would copy over `basic_fc.html`, `cards.js`, and `FlashcardApp.js`.

To write questions for the quiz, open the JavaScript file (.js) that does not include the word "App", such as `cards.js`. Follow the instructions in that file.

To run the quiz, simply open up `basic_fc.html` in your browser.

## Features
### No Server Support Required
You can change the exercise questions using the Javascript arrays contained in each folder. Everything can be uploaded, and will work, on a personal website or university-hosted site.

### Who is this for?

Everyone, especially those without programming experience. I wanted to make something that was easy to make changes to and load up without much fuss. This ease is why I chose to use Google's Material Design framework for styling. You can add these to any website without having to play around with CSS and other scripts. Win-win!

### Answer Security

Please note that these are meant for practice and require some trust of your students. It should be easy for most to find the answers to the quizzes. You should therefore treat these as practice for students to self-test their own skills.

## Can I contribute/fork this project?

Please do! I wrote these with only a few weeks of Javascript under my belt (although experience in other programming languages helped considerably). These are bound to be a bit rough under the edges, but they work well and that's what matters, right?
