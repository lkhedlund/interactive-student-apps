### HOW TO ADD Cards ###

Exercises are coded as javascript arrays in the same folder.

* Each array is organized as follows:
Curly braces '{}' are followed by two words "question" and "answer". A colon ":" after each word is followed by the text you want to include, and a comma ',' is used to separate each item. A final comma ',' before the square closing bracket ']' is not necessary.

* To add a question, for example, you could type the following:
{
"question": "What is a pronoun?",
"answer": "A word that takes the place of a noun.",
},
"question" is the question you want to ask. "answer" is the answer.

* Any html markup contained within the quotation marks will work. If you wanted to bold a word in the question, for example, you could type "What is a <b>pronoun</b>?"
