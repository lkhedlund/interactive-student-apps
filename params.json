{"name":"Interactive Student Applications","tagline":"Web modules containing quizzes, flashcards, and other apps to help teachers connect with students.","body":"This repository houses web modules containing quizzes, flashcards, and other apps to help teachers connect with students. I created these apps for a university professor I worked closely with in the past as part of a site-wide redesign. I hope others will find it useful for their classes as well.\r\n\r\n## No server-side support is required!\r\n\r\nYou can change the exercise questions using the Javascript arrays contained in each folder. Everything can be uploaded, and will work, on a personal website or university-hosted site.\r\n\r\n## Who is this for?\r\n\r\nEveryone, especially those without programming experience. I wanted to make something that was easy to make changes to and load up without much fuss. This ease is why I chose to use Google's Material Design framework for styling. You can add these to any website without having to play around with CSS and other scripts. Win-win!\r\n\r\n## Can I contribute/fork this project?\r\n\r\nPlease do! I wrote these with only a few weeks of Javascript under my belt (although experience in other programming languages helped considerably). These are bound to be a bit rough under the edges, but they work well and that's what matters, right?\r\n\r\n## This is a lot of text! Is there a good way to view the code?\r\n\r\nMy personal recommendation is [Atom](https://atom.io/). It has delightful syntax highlighting and is available on every platform.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
